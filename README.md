### Update 1 

I messed around with some oscillators for 30 minutes and all I made was a horrendous noise machine. 
It is clear I will not master pure-data on my own
However, the creator of pd, Miller Puckette, has a course available on his [website](http://msp.ucsd.edu/syllabi/171.18w/index.htm)
I shall be attempting to complete the homework exercises set by him, and perhaps expanding on them

### Update 2

Downloaded free drum sounds! Before I make a looper that records guitar, I can make a looper that uses pre-recorded sounds activated via a simulated midi keyboard
Found a repo of 1000 samples [here](https://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/sampleradar-1000-free-drum-samples-229460)

### Update 3

Implementing drums... Turns out PD has a very extensive help manual, and I'm starting to get used to "graphic programming", but so far it feels like a poor substitute for good ol' fashioned lines of code.

### Update 1 

I messed around with some oscillators for 30 minutes and all I made was a horrendous noise machine. 
It is clear I will not master pure-data on my own
However, the creator of pd, Miller Puckette, has a course available on his [website](http://msp.ucsd.edu/syllabi/171.18w/index.htm)
I shall be attempting to complete the homework exercises set by him, and perhaps expanding on them
